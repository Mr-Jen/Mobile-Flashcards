This project is my submission for the React Native 'Mobile Flashcards' exericise.

The app allows you to create your own decks to which you can add your own flashcards.
You can take quizzes on any deck you created to test your knowledge.

To install the project, use 'npm install'  to install all the dependecies.

This project was only tested for android devices, since I don't own an IOS devices.
