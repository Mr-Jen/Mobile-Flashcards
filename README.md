This project is my submission for the React Native 'Mobile Flashcards' exericise.

The app allows you to create your own decks to which you can add your own flashcards.
You can take quizzes on any deck you created to test your knowledge.
By default, when you open the app, a notification is prepared for you to remind you to practice.
Whenever you finish a quiz, said notification gets deleted and will be set up for the same time 
the next day.

To install the project, use 'npm install'  to install all the dependecies.
To run the application, use 'yarn start' or 'npm start'. Via the console or the online expo
tools, you can open your android emulator.

This project was only tested for android devices, since I don't own an IOS devices.
